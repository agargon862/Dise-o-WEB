          <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
          <p>
            From San Juan, Puerto Rico, <b>Mora</b> stands out as a creative
            force shaping the future of Latin urban music. Mixing reggaetón,
            trap, and experimental sounds, he turns emotion into rhythm and
            style into identity. <br /><br />
            Recognized for his melodic vision and fearless approach, Mora blends
            introspection with innovation—crafting music that feels both fresh
            and timeless. <br /><br />
            The voice of a generation that moves, thinks, and dreams
            differently.

          <h1>THE origins</h1>
          <p>
            Long before the stages and studios, Mora was a curious kid who found
            music in everything around him. <br /><br />
            At home in Puerto Rico, everyday sounds turned into melodies, and
            creativity became his way to understand the world. <br /><br />
            Between drawings, games, and early rhythms, he began to imagine what
            would later become his life — making others <b>feel </b> through
            sound. <br /><br />
            From those moments, his way of creating was born: guided by
            intuition, emotion, and a genuine connection to what’s real.
            <br /><br />
            That essence is still there — <br /><br />the same kid, still
            experimenting, just with a much bigger stage.
